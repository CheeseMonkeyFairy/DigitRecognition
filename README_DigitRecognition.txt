Handwritten Digit Recognition Neural Network
neural network for handwritten digit recognition, leveraging machine learning to predict digits drawn or uploaded by users. Built with Python (neural network and backend), JavaScript (for frontend interactivity), and HTML/CSS (for web layout), it tracks model accuracy and stores prediction data for analytics.

Instructions to run the Digit Recognition program:
1. in Command prop:
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python
1.5. there might be something about "enabling long file path"
2.open DigitRecognition.py in a text editor(visual studio code)
3.store hand written digits as 28x28 pixel PNGs in folder titled Digits, with each PNG titled digit1.png, digit2.png, digit3.png, etc
4. run DigitRecognition.py and the model will be constructed and trained using the MNIST dataset and it will predict your handwritten digits
